# AlgorithmAnalysis1
This program graphs the complexities of various algorithms, given input data, including Fibonacci's algorithm, Euclid's algorithm for calculating greatest common divisor between two numbers, the problem of Exponentiation using Decrease by One, Decrease by Constant Factor, and Divide and Conquer approaches, and lastly, Insertion Sort and Selection Sort algorithms.

The program makes use of Python's Matplotlib graphing library. Allow approximately 3 minutes for graph to render.
